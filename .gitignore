# NuGet Packages
# Typically, NuGet packages are restored and not committed.
# However, if you have a local packages folder, uncomment the next line:
# **/packages/*
# except for *.nupkg files that are part of the project (e.g. for local NuGet feeds)
# !**/packages/*.nupkg

# Environment files - specific to your setup, ensure these are not committed if they contain secrets
# appsettings.Development.json # (Consider if this contains secrets; often better to use user secrets for development)
# launchSettings.json # (If it contains environment-specific settings not suitable for all users)

# Specific to .NET User Secrets, which should not be committed.
# The secrets.json file is stored in a path outside of the project.
# However, the "userSecretsId" in the .csproj is fine.
